TCPEchoClient 1.0

0.  Select the hardware library that matches the network adaptor you are using. Make sure to look in the hardware library
    header file to see exactly how to configure your board; for example there may be some jumpers to set. If you have
    a network adaptor physically mounted on the chipKIT board, then comment out ALL hardware libraries as the correct software
    will be included with the MPIDE selection of the chipKIT board. For example, the MX7cK has an SMSC-8720 phy on the board
    and uses the MX7 internal network MAC, no hardware library is needed for the MX7cK.

1.  Under ...\libraries\DNETcK\examples\TCPEchoClient\PCCode start the TCPEchoServer, once started the command window should look something like:

            TCPEchoServer Version 1.0.4414.23705
            Digilent, Copyright 2011

            Listening on port 44300

2.  Edit the TCPEchoClient.pde to have the correct IP address of your PC server. You probably only need to 
    Change szIPServer as the port number is the default port.

            /************************************************************************/
            /*                                                                      */
            /*              SET THESE VALUES FOR YOUR NETWORK                       */
            /*                                                                      */
            /************************************************************************/

            char * szIPServer = "192.168.1.180";
            unsigned short portServer = 44300;    

3.  Build and upload TCPEchoClient.pde; before opening the serial monitor, wait about 10 seconds after the sketch is done
    uploading and you should see something like the following in the TCPEchoServer command window:

            TCPEchoServer Version 1.0.4505.27370
            Digilent, Copyright 2011

            Listening on port 44300
            Detected Client
            *Wrote from tcpClient.writeStream*
            *Printed from tcpClient.print*
            *Printed from tcpClient.println*
            *Printed from print.print*
            *Printed from print.println*
            b
            *Wrote from print.write*
            *Wrote from print.write*
            Listening on port 44300

4.  Open the serial monitor at 9600 baud to restart the sketch, after about 10 seconds your serial monitor 
    should display something like:

            TCPEchoClient 1.0
            Digilent, Copyright 2011

            Got Connection
            Bytes Read Back:
            *Wrote from tcpClient.writeStream*
            *Printed from tcpClient.print*
            *Printed from tcpClient.println*
            *Printed from print.print*
            *Printed from print.println*
            b
            *Wrote from print.write*
            *Wrote from print.write*

            Closing TcpClient, Done with sketch.

5.  Your command window should look something like:

            TCPEchoServer Version 1.0.4505.27370
            Digilent, Copyright 2011

            Listening on port 44300
            Detected Client
            *Wrote from tcpClient.writeStream*
            *Printed from tcpClient.print*
            *Printed from tcpClient.println*
            *Printed from print.print*
            *Printed from print.println*
            b
            *Wrote from print.write*
            *Wrote from print.write*
            Listening on port 44300
            Detected Client
            *Wrote from tcpClient.writeStream*
            *Printed from tcpClient.print*
            *Printed from tcpClient.println*
            *Printed from print.print*
            *Printed from print.println*
            b
            *Wrote from print.write*
            *Wrote from print.write*
            Listening on port 44300

6.  Shutdown your sketch.
7.  Shutdown the TCPEchoServer by typing ^C in the command window.
