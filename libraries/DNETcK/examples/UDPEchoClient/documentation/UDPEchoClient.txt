UDPEchoClient 1.0

0.  Select the hardware library that matches the network adaptor you are using. Make sure to look in the hardware library
    header file to see exactly how to configure your board; for example there may be some jumpers to set. If you have
    a network adaptor physically mounted on the chipKIT board, then comment out ALL hardware libraries as the correct software
    will be included with the MPIDE selection of the chipKIT board. For example, the MX7cK has an SMSC-8720 phy on the board
    and uses the MX7 internal network MAC, no hardware library is needed for the MX7cK.

1.  In the ...\libraries\DNETcK\examples\UDPEchoClient\PCCode directory, start UDPEchoServer; once started the command window 
    should look something like:

            UDPEchoServer Version 1.0.4414.23751
            Digilent, Copyright 2011

            Listening on port: 44400.

2.  Edit the UDPEchoClient.pde sketch to have the correct IP address of your PC UDPEchoServer. You probably only need to 
    change szIPServer as the port number is preset to the default port.

            /************************************************************************/
            /*                                                                      */
            /*              SET THESE VALUES FOR YOUR NETWORK                       */
            /*                                                                      */
            /************************************************************************/

            char * szIPServer = "192.168.1.180";
            unsigned short portServer = 44400;    

3.  Build and upload UDPEchoClient.pde. Once uploaded UDPEchoClient automatically starts and after a good 10 seconds you should see
    something like the following in our UDPEchoServer command window:

            UDPEchoServer Version 1.0.4505.28267
            Digilent, Copyright 2011

            Listening on port: 44400.
            Datagram detected:
            *Wrote from udpClient.writeDatagram*
            Listening on port: 44400.

4.  Open the serial monitor button in MPIDE at 9600 baud to restart the sketch, after about 10 seconds your serial monitor 
    should display something like:

            UDPEchoClient 1.0
            Digilent, Copyright 2011

            Writing out Datagram
            Waiting to see if a datagram comes back:
            *Wrote from udpClient.writeDatagram*
            Done waiting, assuming nothing more is coming

            Closing udpClient, Done with sketch.
 
5.  Your command window should look something like:

            UDPEchoServer Version 1.0.4505.28267
            Digilent, Copyright 2011

            Listening on port: 44400.
            Datagram detected:
            *Wrote from udpClient.writeDatagram*
            Listening on port: 44400.
            Datagram detected:
            *Wrote from udpClient.writeDatagram*
            Listening on port: 44400.

6.  Shutdown your sketch.

7.  Shutdown the TCPEchoServer by typing ^C in the command window.
