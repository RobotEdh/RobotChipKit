RemoteWOL 3.0

0.  Select the hardware library that matches the network adaptor you are using. Make sure to look in the hardware library
    header file to see exactly how to configure your board; for example there may be some jumpers to set. If you have
    a network adaptor physically mounted on the chipKIT board, then comment out ALL hardware libraries as the correct software
    will be included with the MPIDE selection of the chipKIT board. For example, the MX7cK has an SMSC-8720 phy on the board
    and uses the MX7 internal network MAC, no hardware library is needed for the MX7cK.

1.  Make sure that the TCP Server address of GatewayIP.190:44200 will work on your network. For example if your 
    Gateway IP is 192.168.1.1, the default Remote WOL server IP will be 192.168.1.190:44200. If either the IP or 
    port will not work on your network, modify them in the sketch to one that will.

            /************************************************************************/
            /*                                                                      */
            /*              SET THESE VALUES FOR YOUR NETWORK                       */
            /*                                                                      */
            /************************************************************************/

            // Set the static IP and listening port
            byte localStaticIP = 190;                                       // this will be the gateway IP with the last byte being 190
            unsigned short listeningPort = DNETcK::iPersonalPorts44 + 200;  // 44000 + 200 = 44200


2.  Compile, upload, and start the serial monitor at 9600 baud. The sketch will go through a sequence of connecting via DHCP
    to obtain your local network parameters such as your Gateway IP, DNS services, submasks and then like. Then it will disconnect
    from the network, calculate the appropriate IP based off of you Gateway IP appending the localStaticIP address, and restart
    the server with the calculated static IP but applying all of your other network parameters as obtained during the DHCP discovery.
    The serial monitor should display something like:

            RemoteWOL 3.0

            Dynamic begin
            Network Initialized
            Static begin
            Network Initialized
            Current Day and UTC time: Mar 27, 2012  22:33:40

            My IP: 192.168.1.190
            Gateway IP: 192.168.1.129
            Subnet mask: 255.255.255.128
            Dns1 IP: 192.168.1.129
            Dns2 IP: 24.113.32.29

            Listening on Port: 44200

3.  Under the ...\libraries\DNETcK\examples\RemoteWOL directory, open a command window and instruct the commandline RemoteWOL application 
    to "wake-up" MAC address 010203040506. While this MAC address is a dummy address, it will tell the RemoteWOL sketch to apply this WOL reqest
    to the local network. Because it is a dummy MAC, no machine will wake up. 

            RemoteWol 192.168.1.190 44200 010203040506

4.  And in the PC command window you should see something like:

            RemoteWol Version 3.0.4370.23263
            Keith Vogel, Copyright 2011

            Magic Packet Sent.

5.  You should see in the serial monitor window the following additional information:

            Got a client
            Current Day and UTC time: Mar 27, 2012  22:39:38
            Broadcast Request Detected
            Request to Wake MAC: 01:02:03:04:05:06 from IP: 192.168.1.180:55200.
            WOL Broadcast Succeeded
            Request Succeeded
 
            Listening on Port: 44200

6.  From the PC you can ask the RomoteWOL sketch to return a history of all requests that it has processed with a command line of:

            RemoteWol 192.168.1.190 44200 -h

7.  In the PC command window you should get something like:

            RemoteWol Version 3.0.4370.23263
            Keith Vogel, Copyright 2011

            Got the broadcast history.
            Local Time: 3/27/2012 3:39:38 PM, MAC: 010203040506 from IP: 192.168.1.180.

8.  In the Serial Monitor window you should get addition output something like:

            Got a client
            Current Day and UTC time: Mar 27, 2012  22:44:02
            History Request Detected
 
            Listening on Port: 44200

9.  You can have the RemoteWOL sketch post as many WOL requests for any MAC by specifying the MAC address as in step 3 above, and 
    get a history of all posted WOL requests by using the command as in step 6 above.
