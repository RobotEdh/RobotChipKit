     Every n miliseconds =>
       call CMD_CHECK to check the followong topics:
        Check Motion
        Check noise
        Check Temperature Variation
        Check Lux Variation
        Check contacts sensors left and right, return in case of obstacle
        Check distance using IR every 1 second, return in case < DISTANCE_MIN
             
     If alert trigerred =>
       call CMD_INFOS to get the following infos:
         0: motor_state
         1: SpeedMotorRight
         2: SpeedMotorLeft
         3: direction
         4: distance
         5: temperature
         6: brightness
         7: noise
         8: alert status
         9: picture number
      
       then =>
         call CMD_ALERT to perform:
            If motor_state == STATE_GO => Stop
            Make 3 pictures left, front and right
            Send Infos + last 3 pictures in WIFI to the PI server if it is activated 

     Else if Photon wants to do something =>
       Read the message received from Photon   
       If it is a command, Execute the command received from Photon and reply to Photon
       If it is a response, Update the robot with the response received from Photon 
    
     Else if the PI server is activated for periodic infos and delay is reached => 
       call CMD_INFOS to get the following infos:
         0: motor_state
         1: SpeedMotorRight
         2: SpeedMotorLeft
         3: direction
         4: distance
         5: temperature
         6: brightness
         7: noise
         8: alert status
         9: picture number
     
       Then send Infos in WIFI to the PI server

         call go to perform:
            Check Contacts sensors right and left
            Check distance minimum with IR every second
            return in case of obstacle
         if obstacle detected during go process then:
