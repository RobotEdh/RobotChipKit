WiFiTCPEchoServer 1.0

0.  Select the hardware library that matches the network adaptor you are using. Make sure to look in the hardware library
    header file to see exactly how to configure your board; for example there may be some jumpers to set. If you have
    a network adaptor physically mounted on the chipKIT board, then comment out ALL hardware libraries as the correct software
    will be included with the MPIDE selection of the chipKIT board. For example, the MX7cK has an SMSC-8720 phy on the board
    and uses the MX7 internal network MAC, no hardware library is needed for the MX7cK.

1.  Make sure that the TCP Server address of 192.168.1.190:44300 will work on 
    your network. If not then modify the server address in the sketch to 
    one that will.

            /************************************************************************/

            IPv4 ipServer = {192,168,1,190};
            unsigned short portServer = DNETcK::iPersonalPorts44 + 300;     // port 44300 


2.  Then modify the szSsid to the SSID of your WiFi network.

            // Specify the SSID
            const char * szSsid = "chipKIT";

3.  Also uncomment the security type that you are using on your WiFi network.
    If you are using OPEN security, then comment all of the secruity types out.

            // select 1 for the security you want, or none for no security
            #define USE_WPA2_PASSPHRASE
            //#define USE_WPA2_KEY
            //#define USE_WEP40
            //#define USE_WEP104
            //#define USE_WF_CONFIG_H

4.  Scroll down to the security type that you are using, and provide the appropriate
    Key information. You only need to update the section for the security type that you
    are using. If you are using WEP, you only have to provide the key for the index
    you are using, make sure you also change the key index (iWEPkey)
    
    If you are using WPA or WPA2 with a pass phrase, understand that it will take
    about 30 seconds for the MRF24WB0MA to calculate the key before the WiFi
    connection can be made. What this means is, your sketch will appear to hang for
    about 30 seconds, so give your sketch a good 40-50 seconds to start before thinking
    anything is wrong. 

            // modify the security key to what you have.
            #if defined(USE_WPA2_PASSPHRASE)

                const char * szPassPhrase = "Digilent";
                #define WiFiConnectMacro() DWIFIcK::connect(szSsid, szPassPhrase, &status)

5.  Compile and upload WiFiTCPEchoServer from MPIDE. Once WiFiTCPEchoServer is uploaded open the serial monitor at 9600 baud. 
    After about 10-50 seconds (depending on your security type) you should see something like:

            WiFiTCPEchoServer 1.0
            Digilent, Copyright 2012

            Connection Created, ConID = 1
            IP Stack Initialized
            Started Listening
            Listening on port: 44300

6.  Under the ...\libraries\DNETcK\examples\TCPEchoServer\PCCode directory start TCPEchoClient.exe; this is a windows Forms application 
    so a window will automatically open.

7.  In TCPEchoClient it defaults to the same hostname IP and port as the sketch was originally coded to. However, if you 
    changed those values, change them in TCPEchoClient before proceeding.

8.  The default "Send Text" in TCPEchoClient is "Text to Echo", you may leave this as is, or change it. This documentation is 
    assuming you left it as is.

9.  The Log in TCPEchoClient should look something like:

            TCPEchoClient Version 1.0.4414.23621
            Digilent, Copyright 2011

10. Click the Send button in TCPEchoClient and wait about 10 seconds. You should see in the serial monitor something like:

            WiFiTCPEchoServer 1.0
            Digilent, Copyright 2012

            Connection Created, ConID = 1
            IP Stack Initialized
            Started Listening
            Listening on port: 44300
            Got 1 clients pending
            Got a Connection
            Got 12 bytes
            Writing: 
            Text to Echo
            Closing TcpClient

            Listening on port: 44300

11. And in the TCPEchoClient you should see something like:

            TCPEchoClient Version 1.0.4414.23621
            Digilent, Copyright 2011
            Info: Please wait, attempting to connect to: 192.168.1.190:44300
            TX: Text to Echo
            Starting to listen
            RX: Text to Echo
            Ending listening

12. If you hit the Send button repeatedly quickly (within a second or so; actually less than 5 seconds).  You will see a repetition 
    of the TX and RX without Start/End listening as the connection is not dropped between sends. Likewise in the serial monitor 
    you will not see the Listening on port: 44300 between the echoes as that connection is not dropped either. 

13. To close TCPEchoClient, hit the RED X.
