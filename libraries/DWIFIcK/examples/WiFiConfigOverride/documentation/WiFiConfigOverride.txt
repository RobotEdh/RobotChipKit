WiFiConfigOverride 1.0

1.  WiFiConfigOverride is almost exactly WiFiTCPEchoServer with the exception that the secruity parameters are taken
    from the WF_Config.x secrity override file located in the sketch (WiFiConfigOverrided) directory. Reading WF_Config.x is
    specified in the code by "conID = DWIFIcK::connect(0, &status)" with a connection ID of 0. While this may seem like an SSID
    of NULL, in fact there is an overloaded method where the first parameter is a connection ID and the value of 0
    should be used, NOT NULL. This method signature is provided for future support of hardware stored connection IDs 
    (configurations other than 0) which will have meaning.

2.  Modify WF_Config.x to contain the security parameters for your network. 

            #define MY_DEFAULT_SSID_NAME                "chipKIT"
            #define MY_DEFAULT_WIFI_SECURITY_MODE        WF_SECURITY_WPA2_WITH_KEY
            #define MY_DEFAULT_PSK_PHRASE               "Digilent"
    
    And then the Key information at the bottom of the file must be updated. Only the Key that you plan to use needs 
    to be updated. If you are using WEP, make sure to also set:

            /* Valid Key Index: 0, 1, 2, 3  */
            #define MY_DEFAULT_WEP_KEY_INDEX        (0u)

    Appropriate MY_DEFAULT_WIFI_SECURITY_MODEs are:

                WF_SECURITY_OPEN                     
                WF_SECURITY_WEP_40                   
                WF_SECURITY_WEP_104                  
                WF_SECURITY_WPA_WITH_KEY             
                WF_SECURITY_WPA_WITH_PASS_PHRASE     
                WF_SECURITY_WPA2_WITH_KEY            
                WF_SECURITY_WPA2_WITH_PASS_PHRASE    
                WF_SECURITY_WPA_AUTO_WITH_KEY                                                
                WF_SECURITY_WPA_AUTO_WITH_PASS_PHRASE

    This file format is exactly as taken from the Microchip MAL implementation and the Microchip TCPIP configuration Wizard
    may be used to modify this file. The Wizard can be found at .../libraries/DNETcK/TCPIP Wizard/TCPIPConfig.exe. When running 
    the Wizard deselect the TCPIPConfig.h options, select the WF_Config.h option and browse to your WF_Config.x file. You do not 
    need to select the advanced options. You will need to select "show all files" as you will be modifying/browsing for a .x file and 
    by default the wizard only looks for .h files.

3.  After you have setup your WF_Config.x file, follow the readme for ...\libraries\DWIFIcK\examples\WiFiTCPEchoServer\documentation\WiFiTCPEchoServer.txt;
    however you will not need to modify any WiFi security information in the sketch as that will be taken from the WF_Config.x file you just modified.
