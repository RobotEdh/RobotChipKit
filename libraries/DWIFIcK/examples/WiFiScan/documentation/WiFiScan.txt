WiFiScan 1.0

0.  Select the hardware library that matches the network adaptor you are using. Make sure to look in the hardware library
    header file to see exactly how to configure your board; for example there may be some jumpers to set. If you have
    a network adaptor physically mounted on the chipKIT board, then comment out ALL hardware libraries as the correct software
    will be included with the MPIDE selection of the chipKIT board. For example, the MX7cK has an SMSC-8720 phy on the board
    and uses the MX7 internal network MAC, no hardware library is needed for the MX7cK.

1. 	Compile WiFiScan, upload, and start the serial monitor at 9600 baud and after
	a few seconds a list of broadcasting WiFi routers should be displayed along
	with any parameters they are broadcasting. Below is an example of 2 broadcasting
	routers.
